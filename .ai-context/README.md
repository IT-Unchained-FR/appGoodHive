# AI Context Directory

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL AI ASSISTANTS (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex):**

Before starting work:
1. Read `current-task.md` to understand what's being worked on
2. Read `decisions.md` to understand architecture choices
3. Check `todos.md` for pending tasks

After completing work:
1. Update `current-task.md` with your progress
2. Add any architecture decisions to `decisions.md`
3. Update `todos.md` by checking off completed items and adding new ones

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When creating git commits:
- **DO NOT mention AI assistance** (Claude, Cursor, Codex, etc.) in commit messages
- Keep commit messages professional and concise
- Follow conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Focus on what changed and why, not who made the change

Example:
```
✅ feat: add user authentication
❌ feat: add user authentication (Generated with Claude Code)
```
