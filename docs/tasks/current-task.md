## 🎯 SMART MATCH SCORE — DEMO PREP (April 20, 2026 meeting)

**Context:** The Smart Match Score feature is 100% implemented. API, Gemini AI, badge component, and both UI pages are wired. Dev and prod migrations, debug-log cleanup, and the company job selector are now complete.

### What was built (all ✅ — no code changes needed)
- `app/db/migrations/match_score_cache.sql` — DB migration (run on dev and prod)
- `app/api/ai/match-score/route.ts` — POST endpoint with 1-hour Gemini cache
- `app/lib/ai/match-score.ts` — Gemini 2.0 Flash prompt + JSON parser
- `app/components/MatchScoreBadge.tsx` — green/yellow/red pill badge with hover tooltip
- `app/components/job-page/YourMatchScoreCard.tsx` — full score card for talent on job detail page
- `app/jobs/[jobId]/page.tsx` — wired: `YourMatchScoreCard` for approved talents, locked placeholder for others
- `app/companies/search-talents/page.tsx` + `talent-result.tsx` — wired: passes `?jobId=` param → shows `MatchScoreBadge` per talent card, fetches scores in parallel batches of 5

### How the demo flow works
1. Company logs in → goes to `/companies/search-talents?jobId=<uuid>` (append a real job UUID from DB)
2. Each talent card loads a `MatchScoreBadge` (animated pulse → green/yellow/red %)
3. Hover the badge → tooltip shows "Why it matches" + "Gaps"
4. Talent logs in → views any published job → sees "AI Match Analysis" section with score bar + pros/cons cards

### P0 — Run DB migration on dev ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Run: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f app/db/migrations/match_score_cache.sql`
- [x] Verify table exists: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "\dt goodhive.match_score_cache"`
- **Why:** Without this migration, every match-score API call will 500 and the badges will never render.

### P0 — Remove debug console.log statements ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Removed leftover debug logs from `app/companies/search-talents/page.tsx` and `app/companies/search-talents/talent-result.tsx`

Remove these leftover debug logs that will clutter Vercel output and shouldn't ship:

**`app/companies/search-talents/talent-result.tsx`:**
- Line 62: `console.log("Talents received:", talents.length);`
- Line 63: `console.log("Sample talent:", talents[0]);`
- Lines 234–237: the per-card `console.log("Talent", talent.userId || index, ":", {...})`

**`app/companies/search-talents/page.tsx`:**
- Line 72: `console.log("Search params received:", params);`
- Line 117: `console.log("Talents found:", talents.length);`
- Line 118: `console.log("Total count:", count);`

After removal run:
```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### P1 — Add "Match by job" UI affordance ← CODEX TASK (nice to have before demo)
Currently the company must manually add `?jobId=<uuid>` to the URL. Add a job selector dropdown to the search-talents filter bar so companies can pick one of their own jobs from a list, which then sets the `?jobId=` param and triggers match scoring.

**Implementation:**
1. `app/companies/search-talents/page.tsx` — fetch company's published jobs:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title FROM goodhive.job_offers
   WHERE user_id = $viewerUserId AND published = true
   ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT 20
   ```
   Pass `companyJobs` array + `selectedJobId` as props to a new client component.
2. New client component (inline or separate): a `<select>` or styled dropdown labeled **"Match talents to job"** that updates `?jobId=` in the URL on change. Use `useRouter().push()` — keep all other existing query params.
3. Place the dropdown in the filter bar, above or beside the existing search/filter controls.
4. When a job is selected, the badge loading state will start immediately (existing behavior in `talent-result.tsx`).

Acceptance: Company can pick a job from the dropdown → talent cards each show match scores without needing to hand-craft the URL.
- [x] Added a company-only "Match talents to job" dropdown that preserves the existing search query params while updating `jobId`

### P2 — Run DB migration on prod ← AFTER DEV VERIFIED
- [x] Confirm dev migration works + match scores returning from Gemini
- [x] Run: `psql "$PROD_DATABASE_URL" -f app/db/migrations/match_score_cache.sql`
- [x] Update `docs/tasks/current-task.md` with prod migration status

- [x] Add `{ expiresIn: "8h" }` to `sign()` call in `app/api/auth/admin/login/route.ts:50-53`
- Currently tokens never expire — security risk

### P1 — ADMIN-003: Implement settings persistence ← CODEX TASK

- [ ] Run migration on prod
- Dev migration log: `docs/admin-panel-db-migration/2026-04-03-phase-1-dev-migration.md`

### P1 — ADMIN-004: Implement audit log (action history) ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Update `app/api/admin/action-history/route.ts` to query `admin_audit_log` table
- [x] Write audit entries in `talents/status/route.ts` (after approval/rejection)
- [x] Write audit entries in `companies/[userId]/route.ts` (after approval/rejection/update)
- [x] Added action history section to talent detail page so audit entries are visible there too

### P1 — ADMIN-005: Fix usersLast7Days stat ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Replace hardcoded `{ count: 0 }` with real query in `app/api/admin/statistics/route.ts:97-98`
- [ ] Verify `goodhive.users.created_at` column exists on prod DB before deploying
- Dev DB verification complete; prod verification is still pending

### P1 — ADMIN-006: Remove console.log from charts ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Delete `console.log` lines from `UserGrowthChart.tsx:23-25`, `JobTrendsChart.tsx`, `analytics/page.tsx`

### P1 — ADMIN-007: Make admin token cookie httpOnly ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Login route sets httpOnly cookie server-side
- [x] Login page removes `Cookies.set("admin_token", ...)` client-side call
- [x] All admin client pages remove `Cookies.get("admin_token")` + `Authorization` header pattern (cookie sent automatically)
- [x] Create logout endpoint `app/api/auth/admin/logout/route.ts`
- ⚠️ Existing admin sessions will expire on deploy — admins must re-login

### P2 — ADMIN-008: Fix dashboard title duplication ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Remove manual `<h1>` from `app/admin/page.tsx` body (AdminPageLayout already renders the title)

### P2 — ADMIN-009: Fix payouts page layout ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Wrap `app/admin/payouts/page.tsx` content in `<AdminPageLayout>`

### P2 — Responsive admin shell + key pages ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Applied Phase 2 responsive layout rules to `AdminPageLayout` and `Sidebar`
- [x] Updated dashboard, analytics, payouts, settings, job detail, talent detail, company detail, and manage-admins for mobile/tablet layouts
- [x] Updated admin edit modal layouts so forms/actions stack cleanly on mobile

### Admin Overhaul Validation / Handoff
- [x] `pnpm lint` runs successfully (warnings only; existing hook-deps and `<img>` warnings remain in repo)
- [x] `pnpm build` succeeds (existing `cssstyle` resolution warnings from `isomorphic-dompurify` and dynamic server usage warnings still print during build)
- [x] `pnpm tsc --noEmit` passes repo-wide
- [x] Admin login now lands on `/admin` correctly after success by normalizing the admin JWT role claim and forcing a fresh navigation after login
- [x] Admin talents search now matches derived full names like `first_name + last_name` instead of only raw row keys such as `email`
- [x] Admin talents page now supports a persisted grid/table view switch, and the table mode exposes the full talent payload with `N/A` for empty values
- [x] Admin talents search is now server-backed, so searches like `Jubayer`, `Juhan`, and `Jubayer Juhan` match across the full directory instead of only the currently loaded page
- [x] Admin talents now use server pagination for faster loading, while DB-backed search/filter/sort still run across the full talent set before pagination is applied
- [x] Removed the `mentorStatus` filter from `/admin/talents` so talent-directory search results are not silently narrowed by mentor-specific review state
- [x] Tightened `/admin/talents` row-table mode by hiding long text columns and replacing file/image URLs with compact open-in-new-tab buttons
- [x] `/admin/talent-approval` now behaves as a true pending-review queue and excludes already approved, deferred, or rejected talent profiles
- [x] `/admin/talents` and `/admin/talent-approval` now show table skeleton loaders during fetches instead of flashing live column headers/content shells
- [x] `/admin/talents` row actions now use a cleaner `View + More` pattern so actions stay aligned and readable without overcrowding the table
- [x] `/admin/talents` edit modal now normalizes rich-text fields for cleaner editing, derives phone country code from selected country, and saves through a real admin `PUT` route
- [x] Admin routes are now isolated from the public wallet/session provider tree, preventing the repeated public-site `Welcome back!` auth loop on `/admin`
- [x] Public wallet auth no longer forces an immediate `/api/auth/me` refresh after successful connect, preventing the repeated `Welcome back!` toast loop when the session cookie is still settling
- [x] Company opportunity cards now use icon-led labeled metadata blocks, status-aware budget styling, and cleaner preview fallbacks so job attributes read clearly instead of as ambiguous pills
- [x] Public job pages now show a locked AI match-analysis placeholder for non-approved or logged-out viewers, so preview deployments no longer make the feature appear missing

### P2 — ADMIN-010: Implement real report generation ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Create `app/api/admin/reports/route.ts` (talents/companies/jobs CSV export)
- [x] Update `handleGenerateReport` in `app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` to trigger actual download

### P2 — ADMIN-011: Replace hand-rolled charts with Recharts ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Check if `recharts` is installed; add if not (`pnpm add recharts`)
- [x] Rewrite `UserGrowthChart.tsx` using `<AreaChart>`
- [x] Rewrite `JobTrendsChart.tsx` using `<AreaChart>` (different color)

### P3 — ADMIN-012: Remove orphaned admin components ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Verify zero imports, then delete: `RoleManager.tsx`, `PermissionsEditor.tsx`, `ActivityFeed.tsx`, `RecentActivity.tsx`, `ApprovalQueue.tsx`, `QuickActions.tsx`, `AdminTable.tsx`, `TableFilters.tsx`, `StatusFilter.tsx`

### P3 — ADMIN-013: Deduplicate Spinner in manage-admins ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Remove inline Spinner in `app/admin/manage-admins/page.tsx`, import from `@/app/components/admin/Spinner`

### P4 — Modal, detail page, and settings redesign ← CODEX TASK
- [x] Restyled `ApprovalPopup`, `RejectionModal`, `BulkApproval`, and `DeleteConfirmDialog` to match the Phase 4 modal spec
- [x] Rebuilt `EditTalentModal` and `EditCompanyModal` with grouped sections, sticky header/footer, and responsive form grids
- [x] Redesigned `app/admin/talent/[user_id]/page.tsx` into the two-column desktop layout with quick actions, skills, contact, and action history cards
- [x] Redesigned `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` with icon-led sections, descriptive switch rows, and a yellow save action

## 🔥 EARLIER STABILIZATION TASKS (carried over)

### P0 — Thirdweb credit exhaustion ← CODEX TASK
**Root cause:** `app/providers.tsx` uses `<ThirdwebProvider>` with no config → defaults to `autoConnect: true` in Thirdweb v5. On every page load, Thirdweb SDK re-authenticates social/embedded wallets against Thirdweb's servers, consuming API credits. `AuthContext.tsx:140-175` has a `useEffect` on `account?.address` that fires on every reconnect, compounding the issue. The plan costs $5/month — the next tier is $90, so we MUST reduce consumption.

**Fix:**
1. In `app/providers.tsx` — change `<ThirdwebProvider>` to `<ThirdwebProvider autoConnect={false}>`. Iron Session (`session_token` cookie) keeps users authenticated; the wallet does NOT need to auto-reconnect on every page to maintain login state.
2. For pages that actually need wallet connection (job creation/publish, payouts) — trigger a manual reconnect via the connect button. The user is already prompted there.
3. In `app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — the `useEffect` on `account?.address` (line 140-175) can stay as-is; it will just not fire on every page load anymore since wallet won't auto-reconnect.

**Do NOT change:** Iron Session auth, session_token cookie handling, or login flow.
**Acceptance:** After change, Thirdweb credit counter should not increment on normal page navigation for logged-in users.

### P0 — DB connection stability
- [ ] Audit all concurrent connections across environments (localhost:3000, localhost:3001, preview, prod)
- [ ] Ensure dev environments use dev DB only; preview uses its own pool
- [ ] Verify `pg` pool settings (`max`) are respected per environment
- **Why:** Connection exhaustion causes random 500s on talent search, job listing, etc.

### P1 — Company job dashboard: jobs not loading ← PARTIALLY FIXED
- [x] **Dev DB migration applied (March 15):** `plan42_01_job_review_status.sql` confirmed — columns `review_status`, `admin_feedback`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by` already existed on dev DB. 5 jobs backfilled to correct status.
- [ ] **⚠️ PROD DB migration still needed** — run `psql "$PROD_DATABASE_URL" -f app/db/migrations/plan42_01_job_review_status.sql` before production deploy
- [ ] Verify Benoit's company jobs now appear correctly on preview after next deploy
- **Root cause was:** Query in `lib/jobs/company-jobs.ts` selected `review_status`/`admin_feedback` — columns that were missing on production DB.

### P1 — Profile submission email: missing Calendly link ← BLOCKED
- [ ] **Blocked: need correct 45-min Calendly URL from Benoit**
- Current hardcoded URL (`app/email-templates/profile-submission-talent.tsx:5`): `https://calendly.com/benoit-goodhive` — may be generic, not the 45-min assessment slot
- Also: email failures are silently swallowed (`my-profile/route.ts:382-386`) — add log/alert so failed sends are visible in Vercel logs
- **Bug:** BUG-001 — Alvaro did not receive appointment link; Benoit had to send manually

### P1 — Admin new-company email: "undefined undefined" ← CODEX TASK
**Root cause:** `app/companies/my-profile/page.tsx:301-305` — the fetch to `/api/send-email` is missing the `name` field. The send-email handler's admin HTML at `app/api/send-email/route.ts:207` uses `${name}` directly (no fallback), producing "undefined".

**Fix — one line in `app/companies/my-profile/page.tsx` around line 301:**
```ts
body: JSON.stringify({
  email: dataForm.email,
  name: dataForm.designation,   // ← ADD THIS LINE
  type: "new-company",
  subject: `Welcome to GoodHive, ${dataForm.designation}! 🌟 Let's Connect You with Top IT Talent`,
}),
```
No other files need changing.

### P2 — Admin talent filter: 204 response ← NO ACTION NEEDED
**Finding:** `app/api/admin/talents/route.ts` already returns `200 + { data: [], pagination: {} }` on empty results. No code bug. Was likely a transient DB connection issue during the meeting. No fix required.

### P2 — Blockchain job publish UX ← CODEX TASK
**Context:** In `app/companies/create-job/JobForm.tsx`, there is no explicit "Publish on Blockchain" button. The current flow is: Save Draft → Submit for Review → (admin approves → published). The "Manage Funds" button (FundManager modal) exists separately but isn't surfaced prominently.

**Fix:**
- After a job is saved (not yet submitted for review), add a banner/callout: *"Fund your smart contract before submitting — this ensures your talent can be paid on-chain."* with a button that opens the FundManager modal.
- The callout should only show if the job has no blockchain funds provisioned yet.
- Do NOT change the submit-for-review flow itself — just add the CTA before it.
- Keep it simple: a yellow info banner (`bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-400`) between the job form and the submit button.

## ⏳ PENDING / NEXT UP

### P1 — Wire Thirdweb USDC payment in mission payout flow
- [x] `app/components/AssignTalentModal.tsx` now sends the on-chain USDC transfer via Thirdweb after `confirm-completion` succeeds
- [x] Waits for the Polygon receipt, then calls `POST /api/payouts/[payoutId]/confirm-tx` with the confirmed `txHash`
- [x] Added pending/success/error UX states in the modal, including a Polygonscan link
- [x] `app/api/assignments/[assignmentId]/confirm-completion/route.ts` now returns `talentWalletAddress` from the talent's linked user wallet

### P2 — Admin payouts page link
- [x] Added "Payouts" to the admin sidebar nav so admins can reach `app/admin/payouts/page.tsx`

### P3 — TASK-007 (blocked)
- Replace blockchain section with video on company profile (waiting on Benoit's video URL)

### P1 — Job detail page guest privacy + redesign (March 30, 2026)
- [x] `app/jobs/[jobId]/page.tsx` now mirrors the job-card privacy contract for guests: job content stays visible, but company identity/profile links stay hidden until auth
- [x] Removed public exposure of company profile links from the guest sidebar state
- [x] Normalized token-address currency display so public budget cards show `USDC` instead of raw contract addresses
- [x] Refactored the page layout for stronger hierarchy, spacing, and mobile-friendly production presentation
- [x] Skills and role description remain public, while company identity/contact access is gated to approved talent / approved companies / admins / job owner
- [x] Removed the old `?connectWallet=true` auto-popup behavior from the navbar and now only clean the query param
- [x] Updated company welcome email CTA copy to use "Start your Talent Sprint" wording with the correct Calendly link
- [x] Expanded admin talent table with direct outreach columns for phone, location, LinkedIn, portfolio, and Telegram plus quick-access actions
- [x] Changed availability label from "Not looking" to "Not available" across the main status UI and stale-availability email copy
- [x] Repaired approved-role drift for talent profiles so approved roles stay active across save/review flows and admin status changes cannot leave profiles stuck as both approved and under review
- [x] Unified talent profile submission emails so only the server-side submission email is sent, using the updated assessment-call Calendly link and the refreshed welcome copy
- [x] Added an in-app interview-call CTA to the talent profile review banner so submitted talents can book the same Benoit Calendly link directly from their profile page
- [x] Polished the company profile photo validation state with softer helper copy, a branded inline error card, and a simplified hero title that now reads "Build Your Company Profile"
- [x] Rebuilt the public company profile page with a calmer 2026-style layout, stronger spacing hierarchy, published-only job cards, and direct contact details gated to approved viewers or admins only
- [x] Cleaned the public job hero so the company summary now sits under the role title and the duplicate job-preview paragraph is removed from the top section
- [x] Tightened the company-profile hero typography and moved the opportunities grid to a full-width section so job cards no longer get squeezed by the sidebar
- [x] Redesigned the job-page company sidebar card so the logo and company summary stack cleanly instead of compressing the text beside the profile image
- [x] Refined company opportunities with active/inactive tabs for owner/admin views, explicit job-status signals, cooler slate budget badges, and human-friendly job metadata labels
- [x] Added Gemini-powered job section cleanup so messy pasted job text is auto-formatted on save and the public job page now renders sanitized rich content instead of escaped raw section HTML
