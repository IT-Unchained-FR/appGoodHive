description: Sync with other AI assistants by reading and updating .ai-context/
---

1. Read all files in .ai-context/ directory to understand current work
2. Show me a summary of:
   - What other AIs are currently working on
   - Recent architecture decisions
   - Pending todos
3. Ask me what I want to work on
4. Update current-task.md to mark me (Claude Code) as working on it
